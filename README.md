# Basic Neural Network from Scratch 
Implemented a basic Neural Network from scratch

The project uses vectorization to implement forward and backward propagation to implement a basic neural network.


## To Run

Set following hyperparameters in `proj.py`

```
lambd --> Lambda or Regularization constant
alpha --> Alpha or Learning rate 
eval --> '' or cost
'': to run main program
cost: Run cost anlaysis
epochs --> Set epoch value
```
For `eval: cost`
set the `network` value like: `[2, 4, 3, 2]`

Run Proj.py
